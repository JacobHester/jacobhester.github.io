			<h1>Design Principles in Mobile Sites</h1>
			<!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs four items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- The site name used in the picture
4- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed!

			<h2>Proximity &mdash; <!-- Replace this comment with the team member name responsible for proximity --></h2>

				<!-- Replace this comment with the web site name shown in the image -->

			<p>
				<!-- Replace this comment with the copy (text) explaining how proximity is being used in the image. --> Www.typeform.com is well organized and and has great proximity. The spacing in between links and headings is well thought out and is easy to read. They have decent sized buttons and links to make mobile viewing fairly easy. They have good examples of using white space and keep their website simple and free of clutter.

			<h2>Alignment &mdash; <!-- Replace this comment with the team member name responsible for alignment --></h2>

				<!-- Replace this comment with the copy (text) explaining how alignment is being used in the image. --> Alignment make the website appealing, when we look at this website, we like it .How it is aligned the text ,photos in this website make it pleasant for our eyes. We want to spend more time in this website.
In this website is easy to scan the page , everything is well organized , search bar is in the corner right , on opposite side is BBC , so it is well aligned .That is well designed and make it , so is easy to find it things we are serching.On top we also see other categories  that make it easy to navigate.On the middle is picture that takes our attention
Alignment makes a good reading experience , photos and text are well aligned .There is little text and it is place in the midle and the right which is easy to read.

			<h2>Repetition &mdash; <!-- Replace this comment with the team member name responsible for repetition --></h2>

				<!-- Replace this comment with the web site name shown in the image --> lds.org
			</p>
			<p>
				<!-- Replace this comment with the copy (text) explaining how repetition is being used in the image. --> I thought LDS.org was a good example of repetition.  Repetition is when you repeat the same element of design throughout the web page. The first thing you see is videos one right after the other. This is a good job at repeating the same graphic type over and over again.  Each video has a blue line on it then under it is the title of each video. The titles are all in the same font and are bold face to unify all the pieces together. This web site shows consistency.

			<h2>Contrast &mdash; <!-- Replace this comment with the team member name responsible for contrast --></h2>
			<img src="/images/IMG_0924.PNG" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use">
			<p>
				<!-- Replace this comment with the web site name shown in the image --> craftsman.com
			</p>
			<p>
				<!-- Replace this comment with the copy (text) explaining how contrast is being used in the image. --> The principle that the Craftsman website demonstrates is contrast. The types of contrast that it exhibits are color, typeface, size and alignment. The way that it uses these features is done in a way that makes it easy for the user to read the presented material, and makes the important features of the page more prominent, and also gives the user a clear path to follow.‚Äù If it needs modifying, just let me know.

			</p>

			<h2>Typography &mdash; <!-- Replace this comment with the team member name responsible for typography --></h2>
			<img src="/images/IMG_0925.PNG" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use">
			<p>
				<!-- Replace this comment with the web site name shown in the image --> Apple.com
			</p>
			<p>
				<!-- Replace this comment with the copy (text) explaining how typography is being used in the image. --> As I searched over different sites I could choose Apple.com stuck out due to its clear and crisp typography. It drew my attention to what was most "important" to apple and made it easy to understand how to navigate the site. The spacing and placement of the text in relation to the images made me dwell on the  image longer. Obviously, Apple is amazing at what they do and thus, this is a good example.
