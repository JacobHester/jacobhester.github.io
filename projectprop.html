    FHE roulette<br><br>

Project Purpose<br><br>

	I currently serve as a Family Home Evening coordinator for my YSA ward here at BYUI. This means that I oversee all the Group leaders (Moms and Dads) to ensure that they are having FHE and that their activities are meaningful. The greatest difficulty is having the college students actually take time for the spiritual side of Family Home Evening. Another difficulty is when the group leaders don’t plan an activity due to indecision or lack of ideas.<br><br>

	The purpose of this website will be to quickly produce a complete “BYUI” family home evening activity at the click of a button. This activity would include a spiritual thought, an activity, and a dessert or snack that could be provided with ease.<br><br>

•	A spiritual thought of 5-10 minutes would replace a full lesson to ensure that college students actually incorporate them in their FHEs (the majority of FHEs are just an activity).<br><br>

•	The activity will be easy, fun, and local to Rexburg, ID. There will be around 30 activities to choose from to ensure boredom isn’t an option.<br><br>

•	The dessert/snack could be assigned to a different apartment weekly and would be easy to make and/or cheap to purchase.<br><br>

	In the end, this site’s end goal is to help FHE families to have spiritual/fun/memorable activities. It’s not to replace the calling of FHE mom and dad, but help them when they can’t think of anything to do.<br><br>



The Audience<br><br>

The Audience would be anyone who participates in a FHE group here at BYUI. I imagine stressed, tired students who are indecisive about what they should plan. They have been unable to completely plan an FHE activity because of all their homework. They use this site to get an idea of some activities that would be easy and enjoyable.<br><br>

Web Pages<br><br>

•	A home page with a header, nav (which would contain links to the different web pages), a footer, and a main content area where the Roulette feature comes into play. By clicking on the roulette wheel they would trigger a javascript function that would spit our into three separate divs 1 randomly selected spiritual thought, activity, and snack/dessert.
•	A page with a list of links to all the preformed spiritual thoughts/ talks/ videos.
•	A page with a list of links to all the activities.
•	A page with a list of links to all the snack/dessert ideas.
•	A page devoted to an explanation of who I am, why I made the page, and the blessings of faithful Family Home Evening.<br><br>

*each page would contain the same header and footer to allow easy navigation between the pages.<br><br>
