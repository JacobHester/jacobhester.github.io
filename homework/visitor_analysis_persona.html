				<h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
				Business Insider is obviously geared toward people who are interested in a business oriented news site. I accessed this site from using LinkedIn and really liked the mobile interface that I used. They play to the older generation that has a larger education and live in larger cities. This site provided news articles that were interesting to this demographic and did it in a very simple, but clean way. The articles were tagged with a theme (being sports, news, business, etc.) and they were easy to find and scroll through. The navigation drop down menu was really well done and made the UX pretty nice. This drop down bar was what most impressed me. It looked really nice and the animation it used made the site feel futuristic and cutting-edge. All and all the site made mobile news articles accessible and easy.

This individual will come to the site because they seek news that is entertaining and relevant to their business related profession. They can also seek news from major news sources, but find a smaller concentration of business related articles. The users will access this site while at their jobs or on their mobile phones. It wouldn’t be a serious research site, but they would pass time and read opinion articles to expand their knowledge of current business activity. <br><br>

The user accesses his laptop computer and mobile smart phone on a regular daily basis. They have all the current software that is available. This user will spend more time on their mobile phone or tablet then they do on their computer.

                <p> This site was horribly arraigned and they didn’t fit their website to any type of demographic. I had to access this site for my science class and it looked pretty bad. I’m not sure who their audience was or if it even completes it’s objective. They did not organize their content in an organized fashion. In a mobile environment the website wasn’t modified and thus was difficult to navigate. </p>
